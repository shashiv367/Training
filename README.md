# Shashi Vardhan Penthala – Portfolio

A single-page, responsive portfolio built with semantic HTML and modern CSS (dark theme) to showcase profile, education, skills, certificates, projects, and achievements.

## Structure
- `index.html` – Content and layout of the portfolio sections.
- `style.css` – Theming, spacing, layout, and responsive styles.

## How to View
1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Ensure `style.css` sits alongside `index.html` in the same folder (it is already linked via a relative path).

## Customization
- Update text (name, links, sections) directly in `index.html`.
- Adjust colors or spacing via CSS variables at the top of `style.css`.
- Add more badges, project tags, or sections by duplicating existing blocks in the HTML.

## Notes
- The layout is responsive and stacks neatly on mobile.
- External links (Portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub) open in a new tab.
